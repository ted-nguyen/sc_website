        <p>We are a multi-disciplinary team of legal, economics, and data science students and researchers based at Santa Clara University that produces empirical research to remove the barriers faced by people with criminal records, some of which include members of the team. We also bring together lawyers, technologists, activists, impacted leaders, and nonprofits to hack second chances by harnessing what Bryan Stevenson has called the power of proximity [link], through our annual Second Chances and Empathy Hackathons [internal link]</p>
